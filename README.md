# Microcode
University project developed by me ([GabrielTofvesson](https://github.com/GabrielTofvesson)) and my
lab partner Edvard Th√∂rnros ([FredTheDino](https://github.com/FredTheDino)).

This repository is copied verbatim from its original repository (https://gitlab.liu.se/edvth289/TSEA28-Microkod.git),
but since that repository is private (because of university lab policies), I have, with the permission of the
course examiner, posted it here instead.

More interesting information can be found in the README files of the other branches.


# Requirements
To compile and run the microcompiler and one of the ASM compilers in the other branches, you will need Kotlin.
Python is also required for one of the ASM compilers and for the microcode preprocessor.

# Branches

* `master`: I don't really know what this branch contains, but it's not useful for much

* `dev`: The interesting branch. We include two ASM compilers and a microcode compiler, along with our own microprogramming language

* `hdl`: A small modification to the `dev` branch adding support for the generation of Verilog instead of microcode
