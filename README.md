## Compiler/weaver directives

### \#define \[name] [const]
Define a compile-time constant. This will replace all (valid) constant
declarations with the given name with the value supplied here.

**NOTE**: Constant names are case-insensitive; i.e. *FOO* and *foo* are
functionally indistinguishable to the compiler.


### \#data \[address] [const]
Define an initial value in the program memory at the given address.


### $[label]
Define a compile-time label at the given position in the microprogram. Labels
can be referenced using an '@' symbol.

For example: *$BAR* would declare a label *BAR* which can be referenced with
*@BAR*.

**NOTE**: Label names are case-insensitive; i.e. @*FOO* and @*foo* are
functionally indistinguishable to the compiler.


### \#optable \[index] {[label] | [const]}
Declare an entry in the opcode jump table (K1).

**NOTE**: The given index must be at most 15 and at least 0 and in the case of
a constant being supplied as the value, this value my not be negative nor be
greater than 127.


### \#amode \[index] {[label] | [const]}
Declare an entry in the addressing mode jump table (K2).

**NOTE**: The given index must be at most 3 and at least 0 and in the case of
a constant being supplied as the value, this value my not be negative nor be
greater than 127.


## Flags
Flags - *aside from L* - are set based on ALU operations, so they depend on
**AR** and the **BUS**. Henceforth, unless otherwise implied or stated, **AR**
will refer to the state/value of **AR** *after* an ALU operation.

### Z
Set if **AR** == **0**

### N
Set if sign bit in **AR** is set.

### O
Set if sign of **AR** differs from signs of both **AR** and **BUS** *before*
the arithmetic operation.

### C
Set if **AR** is less than or equal to **AR** *before* the arithmetic
operation.

### L
Set if **LC** == 0.


## Registers
Available registers for read/write operations are documented below. Unless
otherwise specified, the registers are directly accessible via the bus for read
and write operations.

### AR
The accumulator register. This register can only be written to as the result of
an ALU operation. This is to say, that AR is indirectly writable via the ALU,
but is nonetheless directly readable via the bus.

### PM
The program-memory pseudo-register allows you to read/write values from the
currently accessed program memory address (see **ASR**).

### ASR
The address register; this register is used to specify which address of
program-memory to be accessible via **PM**.

**NOTE**: This register cannot be read.

### HR
The help register. This is a general-purpose register which is useful for
storing ephemeral or intermediate values during a computation.

### IR
The instruction register. This register offers extra functionality such as K1-
and K2-table addressing via the OP and M bits respectively. The GRx and M bits
can also be used to address a specific general register via the GR multiplexer
(see **GR**).

### GR
This is a shorthand for accessing the general register currently made available
by the GR multiplexer when said MUX is controlled by the GRx bits in **IR**.

**NOTE**: Only one GR can be accessed per cycle. Which register this is (of
the four available registers) is determined by the value in **IR**.

### GRM
This is a shorthand for accessing the general register currently made available
by the GR multiplexer when said MUX is controlled by the M bits in **IR**.

**NOTE**: Only one GR can be accessed per cycle. Which register this is (of
the four available registers) is determined by the value in **IR**.

### LC
The loopcounter register is a special register that can only be modified in
three ways: all three ways are dictated by the L-field in the microprogram.
Additionally, the counter can remain unchanged by simply not specifying an
action to take for the register. The three ways of modifying it are as follows:

* Decrement counter by one. The corresponding uASM instruction for this is
`declc`
* Load value from bus. The uASM instruction being `mov [reg] LC`
* Load a 7-bit constant from micromemory. The uASM instruction for this is
`lcset [const]`

**NOTE**: LC cannot be read and can only be written to as detailed above. The
value in LC can, though, to some degree be inferred from the L-flag
(see [*Flags*](#flags)).

## Sorting algorithms
For the sorting competition, we have chosen to focus on implementing bucketsort
with an inline insertionsort when inserting values into corresponding buckets.

### bucksort.uc

This was the first attempt at a sorting implementation in uASM. It doesn't do
more than a simple hash and possibly updating some bucket-specific values.
Nonetheless, it formed a clear basis for future implementations.

Pros:
* N/A

Cons:
* N/A

Average cycle count: N/A


### bsrt.uc

The first successful uASM bucketsort implementation. It uses the aforementioned
inline insertionsort. Additionally, it employs a lookup table for pointing to
buckets; this had the benefit of significantly decreasing the cycles required
to hash values, as well as allowing for buckets of sizes other than even
exponents of 2 (as opposed to other implementations). On top of this, it used a
parallel-hashing system which allowed the rotation step of the hash algorithm
to be applied to two elements of the list (to be sorted) at once, further
decreasing the amount of cycles required to perform a hash (per element).

Pros:
* Variable bucket size
* Arbitrary bucket arrangement
* Parallel-hash implementation
* Uses the most recent merge algorithm (rated around 400 cycles)

Cons:
* Heavy bookkeeping due to lookup table paired with parallel-hash
* Inefficiency in merge due to lookup table (average loss of 80 cycles)

Average cycle count: 1250


### sort2.uc

A second iteration of the *bsrt* implementation, this one refines the dual-hash
by omitting the lookup table. This means that bookkeeping can be minimized, as
it was only necessary due to a lack of available registers. This, of course,
comes at the cost of not being able to have variable-sized buckets; i.e. their
sizes must an exponent of 2. A minor optimization that was created for this
algorithm was the hash-based bookkeeping, wherein a small optimization to
bookkeeping could be done during the hashing of the list elements. Any
bookkeeping which does not require the ALU can, in fact, be performed during the
hashing, since the rotation steps only require AR and HR to be untouched. All
other operations are permitted.

Pros:
* Merge: (320-330 cycles)
    * Direct addressing fits optimally due to register limitations
    * Optimized regster allocations
* Minimal bookkeeping since it is mostly performed during the hashing operation

Cons:
* Bucket sizes must be exponents of 2
* Fixed bucket indices based on hash
* Two merge operations required (negative + positive)
* 95 unused program-memory addresses

Average cycle count: 1100


### sort3.uc

A third iteration of the *bsrt* implementation: this time entirely scrapping
the bucket header, opting to delegate this behaviour to the lookup-table itself.
I.e. the lookup table no long points to the start of a bucket (as this can be
inferred later), but rather points to the last element of the bucket.
Additionally, this implementation scraps the insertion-sort performed in the
bucket sort, delegating this task to the merge stage of the sorting algorithm.

Pros:
* Constant-time bucket sort (406 cycles)
* More optimally used LUT
* No bookkeeping during bucket-sort

Cons:
* Non-constant-time merge
* Optimized LUT requires marginally more arithmetic operations over other variants

Average cycle count: N/A (not fully implemented)


### bsrt2.uc

A fourth iteration developed in parallel with *sort3* as a proof-of-concept of
the recently designed lookup-table replacement for hashing. This version is an
almost direct copy of *bsrt*, except without a LUT, a K1 jump-table and absolute
sizes in the bucket headers (as opposed to a pointer to the last element of a
bucket).

Pros:
* Highly optimized K1 jump-table
* Subroutined jump-table for possible reuse elsewhere
* 13 elements per bucket (+1 over *bsrt*)
* Low instruction count

Cons:
* Only sorts one element per iteration

Average cycle count: 1050


### sort4.uc

A fifth iteration of the common bucketsort algorithm. This one is, as its name
implies, based on the *sort2* algorithm. It improves upon it by making heavy
use of the `call` and `ret` instructions. I.e. by moving the entire bucketsort
implementation to a subroutine, it effectively allows 16 calls to sort values
per iteration of the outermost loop. This conversion to a subroutine is done at
zero cost to performance, as it exploits the fact that a call to a jumptable-
based hashing algorithm is made and rather than returning to the algorithm
after the hashing has taken place, the hash-table simply jumps to the
insertionsort immediately, after which a `ret` is used to return back to normal
execution. This has the effect of reducing a bucketsort of a single value be
two instructions to dereference the value to sort, during which a call to the
subroutine is made and after sorting, it continues execution at the instruction
immediately after the dereference.

Pros:
* Optimized K1 jump-table with inline bucketsort
* Highly un-rollable bucketsort implementation
* Highly efficient bus use (almost always saturated)
* Dynamic bucket placement, allowing for very fast merge operations
* Efficient use of general registers to reduce arithmetic operations requiring
constant values

Cons:
* Maximum of 6 elements per bucket
* 96 unused program-memory addresses (+1 per bucket)
