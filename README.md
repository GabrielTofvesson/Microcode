## Compiler/weaver directives

### \#define \[name] [const]
Define a compile-time constant. This will replace all (valid) constant
declarations with the given name with the value supplied here.

**NOTE**: Constant names are case-insensitive; i.e. *FOO* and *foo* are
functionally indistinguishable to the compiler.


### \#data \[address] [const]
Define an initial value in the program memory at the given address.

### $[label]
Define a compile-time label at the given position in the microprogram. Labels
can be referenced using an '@' symbol.

For example: *$BAR* would declare a label *BAR* which can be referenced with
*@BAR*.

**NOTE**: Label names are case-insensitive; i.e. @*FOO* and @*foo* are
functionally indistinguishable to the compiler.


## Flags
Flags - *aside from L* - are set based on ALU operations, so they depend on
**AR** and the **BUS**. Henceforth, unless otherwise implied or stated, **AR**
will refer to the state/value of **AR** *after* an ALU operation.

### Z
Set if **AR** == **0**

### N
Set if sign bit in **AR** is set.

### O
Set if sign of **AR** differs from signs of both **AR** and **BUS** *before*
the arithmetic operation.

### C
Set if **AR** is less than or equal to **AR** *before* the arithmetic
operation.

### L
Set if **LC** == 0.


## Sorting algorithms
For the sorting competition, we have chosen to focus on implementing bucketsort
with an inline insertionsort when inserting values into corresponding buckets.

### bucksort.uc

This was the first attempt at a sorting implementation in uASM. It doesn't do
more than a simple hash and possibly updating some bucket-specific values.
Nonetheless, it formed a clear basis for future implementations.

Pros:
* N/A

Cons:
* N/A

Average cycle count: N/A


### bsrt.uc

The first successful uASM bucketsort implementation. It uses the aforementioned
inline insertionsort. Additionally, it employs a lookup table for pointing to
buckets; this had the benefit of significantly decreasing the cycles required
to hash values, as well as allowing for buckets of sizes other than even
exponents of 2 (as opposed to other implementations). On top of this, it used a
parallel-hashing system which allowed the rotation step of the hash algorithm
to be applied to two elements of the list (to be sorted) at once, further
decreasing the amount of cycles required to perform a hash (per element).

Pros:
* Variable bucket size
* Arbitrary bucket arrangement
* Parallel-hash implementation
* Uses the most recent merge algorithm (rated around 400 cycles)

Cons:
* Heavy bookkeeping due to lookup table paired with parallel-hash
* Inefficiency in merge due to lookup table (average loss of 80 cycles)

Average cycle count: 1250


### sort2.uc

A second iteration of the *bsrt* implementation, this one refines the dual-hash
by omitting the lookup table. This means that bookkeeping can be minimized, as
it was only necessary due to a lack of available registers. This, of course,
comes at the cost of not being able to have variable-sized buckets; i.e. their
sizes must an exponent of 2. A minor optimization that was created for this
algorithm was the hash-based bookkeeping, wherein a small optimization to
bookkeeping could be done during the hashing of the list elements. Any
bookkeeping which does not require the ALU can, in fact, be performed during the
hashing, since the rotation steps only require AR and HR to be untouched. All
other operations are permitted.

Pros:
* Merge: (320-330 cycles)
    * Direct addressing fits optimally due to register limitations
    * Optimized regster allocations
* Minimal bookkeeping since it is mostly performed during the hashing operation

Cons:
* Bucket sizes must be exponents of 2
* Fixed bucket indices based on hash
* Two merge operations required (negative + positive)
* 95 unused program-memory addresses

Average cycle count: 1100
